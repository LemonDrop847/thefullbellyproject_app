<h3>Problem Statement: </h3>
Hunger remains a major worldwide issue, with millions of people suffering from food instability and malnutrition. The United Nations has set a target of achieving zero starvation by 2030, but this will necessitate a thorough and long-term strategy. To achieve 0% starvation, everyone must have year-round access to adequate, secure, and healthy food. After looking at the burning situation many people have decided to help person in need by giving remaining good food instead of throwing them. But, it is hard to communicate between donor, NFOs & person in need. So we need the project FUllBelly to identify and implement innovative solutions to connect the surplus food to the needful that can led to improve food security and reduce hunger in vulnerable communities.

<h3> Our Solution :</h3>
The Full Belly Project is an APP dedicated to decreasing food wastage and tackling hunger problems in communities worldwide. Through our APP services, the organization connects surplus food from kind donors with respective NGOs and distributes it to those in need. We are not only decreasing food waste, but also offering a long-term answer to food insecurity. The Full Belly Project works diligently to ensure that no one goes famished by redistributing excess food to those in need. The Full Belly Project envisions a future in which everyone has access to nutritious sustenance and is free of starvation and malnutrition.
